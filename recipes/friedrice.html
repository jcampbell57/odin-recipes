        <h2>So good!</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe that I like to meal prep and bring to work with a chicken entree!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, stemmed, cored and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and finely minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup peas (defrost if frozen)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups cooked white rice, cooled</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup Shaoxing wine, or water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional)</li>
            <li> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup minced cilantro or scallions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or a large skillet, and turn heat to high. When it begins to shimmer, add onion, pepper and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove vegetables to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Drain peas if necessary, and add them to skillet; cook, shaking pan, for about a minute, or until hot. Remove them to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Put remaining oil in the skillet, followed by garlic and ginger. When the mixture is fragrant, about 15 seconds later, add the rice, breaking up clumps with a spoon as you go along and tossing it with oil. When the rice is well coated, make a well in the center and break the eggs into it. Scramble these, then stir into the rice.</li>
            <li>Return vegetables to the skillet and stir to integrate. Add wine or water and cook, stirring, for approximately 1 minute. Add soy sauce, sesame oil, and oyster sauce, then taste and add salt and pepper if necessary. Turn off heat, stir in the cilantro and serve.</li>
        </ol>
